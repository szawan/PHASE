# PHASE: PHenotype prediction with Attention mechanisms for Single-cell Exploring.

PHASE utilizes an attention-based neural network framework to predict clinical phenotypes from scRNA-seq data while providing interpretability of key features linked to phenotypic outcomes at both the gene and cell levels. PHASE consists of several components: a data-preprocessing procedure, a gene feature embedding module, a self-attention (SA) module for cell embedding learning, and a pivotal attention-based deep multiple instance learning (AMIL) module for aggregating all single-cell information within a sample.
