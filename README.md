# PHASE: PHenotype prediction with Attention mechanisms for Single-cell Exploring

**PHASE** utilizes an attention-based neural network framework to predict clinical phenotypes from scRNA-seq data while providing interpretability of key features linked to phenotypic outcomes at both the gene and cell levels. PHASE consists of several components:
- A data-preprocessing procedure
- A gene feature embedding module
- A self-attention (SA) module for cell embedding learning
- An attention-based deep multiple instance learning (AMIL) module for aggregating all single-cell information within a sample
